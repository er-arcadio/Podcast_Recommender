# "This American Life" Podcast Recommender

### Project 5 at Metis - ["This Repo"](https://github.com/er-arcadio/Podcast_Recommender)

**Objective: "How can we get more people to get into podcast listening?"**

The goal of the project is to attempt to use data science techniques to make it easier on users to start listening to podcasts, and use machine learning to generate personalized recommendations so that they can continue once they've started. The transcripts of each podcast will be carefully scraped from thisamericanlife.org, explored and visualized via Jupyter Notebook, modeled via a flask app, and summarized in [this Youtube video](https://youtu.be/d5uRXDlIP3g).
